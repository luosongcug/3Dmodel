Hi, everyone,

We obained high resolution 3-D crustal model in the Middle-Lower Yangtz River region, China.
This directory contains the 3D model data.
It consists of files: vs_3d.mod (S-wave velocity), vp_3d.mod (P-wave velocity) and rho_3d.mod (density).
Each file has a format of "longitude(degree)  latitude(degree)  depth(km)  xxx", where "xxx" represents Vs(km/s), Vp(km/s) and rho(g/cm3) for vs_3d.mod, vp_3d.mod and rho_3d.mod, respectively.

For more information about the 3D model, you can refer to the following paper:
